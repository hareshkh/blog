I am a sophomore in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee][IITR].

I was born and raised in Amritsar, Punjab and did my schooling from [DAV International School, Amritsar][DAVIS]. Since childhood I have been interested in many things and tried hands on various activities like harmonium, guitar, skating, badminton and much more. After school, I took the JEE exam and got an All India Rank of 392 and landed up in IIT Roorkee, a decision which I will never regret.

I had started programming in C and slowly I have learnt C++, Java, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP and Python.

Anything related to computers interests me but Android Development is my personal favorite. I love swimming (though I am still a noob). I also like to scribble at times but mostly on a piece of paper.

I'm involved in a lot of campus socities like [Mobile Development Group (MDG)][MDG], [WatchOut! News Agency][WoNA], [ACM Student Chapter][acm].
